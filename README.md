# Ja-synthesizer Game
View synthesizer game here!

The game will attract people to play and practice their listening skills whilst advertising relevant music production products, such as synthesizer and sound effects plugins.

#User Experience (UX)
First time visitors may be discovering what the website is about. They will want the presentation to be clear, minimalistic and understandable and quick learnt with minimal explanations. This is to ensure they don't get put off trying the game and that they stay for long enough for the advertisements to have more effect. The game will simply be a button that plays a sound and the visitor has access to a synth keyboard to guess and play the note. This will help train their ear to recognise the notes being played. A correct guess will result in a visual reward, such as the key lighting up green, or red if the note is incorrect so that the player will know that they guessed incorrectly.

returning visitors may return because they find the game useful, however the game will be very simple and not much progress can be made beyond recognising notes by ear. Ideally the synthesizer will offer some extra features for a little more fun. These features will be pre-made sounds to choose from and possibly some audio parameters to tweak. This feature can encourage the visitor to enjoy playing with synthesizers and encourage them to purchase relevant products displayed in the advertisements on the page.

## Design
I would like to design the website to have the colours of pink blue and black as I've often seen electronic musicians have a preference for those colours.
The font should be something basic and easy to read. Nothing fancy as there will not be much writing on the page.
I would like the keys of the synthesizer to catch the eye when the visitor opens the page so that they soon figure out what the page can do. The button for playing the audio game should be above the synth keys to illustrate that the button needs to be pressed first in order to play the game.

## Bugs and problems
Struggled to organise the colour changes; 1. for when the player is clicking on keys without playing the game. 2. to show the play the correct and incorrect keys when playing the game. Often the keys reverted back to the wrong colour. Found that using "this" was causing the problems and had to use more specific lines of code which were much longer.

I decided to add an alert to congratulate or commiserate the user on their efforts, but this caused problems for playing the synth after without the game function.
